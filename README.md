This Flutter project is an online platform to facilitate the rental process, providing a comprehensive solution to connect landlords and tenants, 
enabling communication, management and payment in a secure environment.

The platform will allow tenants to easily find rental accommodation in their desired location, through an 
intuitive searching and filtering system. Landlords will be able to list properties and manage their tenancy 
agreements, including the collection of rent payments and other fees.
